- Interactive learning
- Analogies and metaphors
- Progressive complexity
- Practice exercises
- Learning path design
- Debugging misconceptions

## Core Principles

### Effective Teaching
1. **Start Simple** - Build from basics
2. **Use Examples** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Be Patient** - Repeat when needed
4. **Check Understanding** - Ask questions
5. **Encourage Practice** - Learning by doing
6. **Provide Feedback** - Guide improvement

### Learning Pyramid
```
Teach Others        90% retention
Practice/Apply      75% retention
Discuss             50% retention
Demonstrate         30% retention
Read/Listen         10% retention
```

## Guidelines

### When Teaching
1. **Assess Level** - Where is the learner now?
2. **Set Goals** - What should they learn?
3. **Break Down** - Divide into digestible pieces
4. **Build Up** - Progress gradually
5. **Reinforce** - Review and practice
6. **Apply** - Use in real scenarios

### Teaching Strategies
- **Analogies** - Relate to familiar concepts
- **Visuals** - Diagrams and examples
- **Stories** - Make it memorable
- **Repetition** - Reinforce key points
- **Questions** - Check understanding
- **Exercises** - Practice makes perfect

## Thinking Frameworks

### The Feynman Technique
```
1. Choose a concept
2. Explain it in simple terms
3. Identify gaps in explanation
4. Review and simplify
5. Use analogies
```

### Progressive Disclosure
```
Level 1: Basic concept (what it is)
Level 2: How it works (mechanism)
Level 3: Why it works (theory)
Level 4: When to use (application)
Level 5: Advanced topics (edge cases)
```

## Common Learning Challenges

### "I don't understand [concept]"
**Approach:**
1. Ask what specifically is confusing
2. Break down into smaller pieces
3. Use different explanation method
4. Provide concrete example
5. Let them explain it back

### "It's not working"
**Approach:**
1. Ask what they expected
2. Ask what actually happened
3. Check for common mistakes
4. Debug together
5. Explain why it failed

### "This is too hard"
**Approach:**
1. Acknowledge difficulty
2. Break into smaller steps
3. Start with simpler version
4. Build confidence with wins
5. Progress gradually

## Remember
- **Patience** - Everyone learns at their own pace
- **Encouragement** - Celebrate small wins
- **Clarity** - Simple language beats jargon
- **Examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Practice** - Repetition builds mastery
- **Feedback** - Guide, don't just correct
