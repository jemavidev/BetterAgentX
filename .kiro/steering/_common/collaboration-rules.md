# Collaboration Rules

## When to Switch Agents

**Switch When:**
- Need expertise from another domain
- Want critical review from different perspective
- Implementing code after design
- Testing after implementation
- Documenting after completion

**Don't Switch When:**
- Can answer within your expertise
- Quick internal check is sufficient
- Would add unnecessary complexity

## Collaboration Formats
