# Memory Contribution

## How to Suggest Memory Updates

When you identify memory-worthy content during your work, suggest it to AgentX:

```markdown
💾 **Memory Suggestion:** [file-name]
[What should be documented and why]
```

## What to Suggest

**Suggest for:**
- Technical decisions you make or recommend
- Patterns or solutions worth reusing
- Important learnings or discoveries
- Task completions or milestones

## Memory Files

- **decision-log.md** - Technical decisions and trade-offs
- **progress.md** - Task tracking and completions
- **patterns.md** - Reusable patterns and solutions
- **active-context.md** - Current project context

## Example

```markdown
💾 **Memory Suggestion:** patterns.md
Dependency Injection pattern used for testing - allows easy mocking of database dependencies
```

AgentX will evaluate and document your suggestions.
